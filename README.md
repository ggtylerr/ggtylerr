[![ggtylerr's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=ggtylerr&show_icons=true&bg_color=001B40&title_color=FFFFFF&text_color=00DBFF&icon_color=FFFFFF&count_private=true)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

*Note: I usually code locally and commit once I'm happy with said code, so the total commits stat is much lower than how much I code.*

*GitHub doesn't count commits for forks either, so unfortunately it doesn't count a lot of commits.*

üòÄ About me
=====
I'm a dev that occasionally makes projects. I also (rarely) stream and make videos.

You can contact me through [my various accounts listed here.](https://www.ggtylerr.dev/social) Please note that some of them are not meant for professional use, mainly anything for games (like Discord and Steam.) The best way to contact me for professional use is through email, however I will most likely respond fastest over Discord.
